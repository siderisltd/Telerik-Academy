A date and time format string defines the text representation of a 
DateTime or DateTimeOffset value that results from a formatting operation . 
It can also define the representation of a date and time value that is required 
in a parsing operation in order to successfully convert the string to a date and time.
 A custom format string consists of one or more custom date and time format specifiers. 
Any string that is not a standard date and time format string is interpreted as a custom 
date and time format string.
