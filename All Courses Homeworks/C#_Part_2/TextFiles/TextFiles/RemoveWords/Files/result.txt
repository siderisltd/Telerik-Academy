Brain drain, which is the of having highly skilled and educated leaving their country to work abroad, has become one of the developing countries concern. Brain drain is also referred to as human capital flight. More and more third world science and technology educated are heading for more prosperous countries seeking higher wages and better conditions. This has of course serious consequences on the sending countries.

While many that immigration is a personal choice that must be understood and respected, others look at the phenomenon from a different perspective. What makes those educated leave their countries should be seriously considered and a distinction between push and pull factors must be made. The push factors low wages and lack of satisfactory and conditions. Social unrest, political conflicts and wars may also be determining causes. The pull factors, however, intellectual freedom and substantial funds for research.

Brain drain has on the sending countries economic prospects and competitiveness. It reduces the number of dynamic and who can contribute to the development of their country. Likewise, with more entrepreneurs taking their investments abroad, developing countries are missing an opportunity of wealth creation. This has also consequences on tax revenue and employment.

Most of the measures taken so far have not had any success in alleviating the effects of drain. A more global view must take into consideration the provision of adequate and conditions in the sending countries. An other option should involve encouraging the expatriates to contribute their skill to the development of their countries without necessarily physically relocating.
